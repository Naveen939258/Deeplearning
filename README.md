## 📖 Introduction

It contains two major components:

1. **Fruit Image Classifier**  
   An interactive Streamlit web app that allows users to upload fruit images and classify them into one of five categories: Apple, Banana, Dates, Guava, and Jujube using a pretrained TensorFlow Keras model.

2. **Deep Learning Models on Date Fruit Dataset**  
   A Flask-based web application showcasing multiple PyTorch experiments applying deep learning techniques on tabular data from the Date Fruit dataset, including model training, evaluation, and visualization.
